        <h1>Our Legacy</h1>
        <p class="par">
          With a legacy that has endured more than six decades it comes as
          little surprise that Home Furniture’ craftsmanship is the world wide
          benchmark for furniture heirlooms of future generations. This family
          business was started by brothers John and Bill Doe who brought their
          inherited fine crafting skills from the foothills of the Italian
          Dolomite Mountains in the 1950’s and established their ‘Modellers’
          workshop in Johannesburg. Today, as Home furniture, the business
          remains family-run boasting two elegant showrooms in Johannesburg’s
          Parktown North and De Waterkant in Cape Town. <br />
          <br />
          We mainly focus on the sale of furniture however we are considering to
          extend our services even into crafting home electronic appliances.
